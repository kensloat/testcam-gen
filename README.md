# Test Camera Generator
This is a simple script to generate some camera images on Linux.
Really, it doesn't generate anything but rather just calls the
needed commands to do so.

## Requirements/Dependencies
v4l2loopback (https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback)   
gst-launch-1.0   

## Instructions
After ensuring all dependencies are installed, simply execute
the script:   
`./testcam-gen.sh`
